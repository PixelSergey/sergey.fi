This is a PSA: you can disagree with anyone, **including yourself**, at any time, **including immediately**.

I was inspired by Chris Lakin's post titled
[you can delete posts that no longer resonate with you](https://chrislakin.substack.com/p/you-can-delete-posts-that-no-longer).
After being made aware of the option, I have actively deleted and modified posts that I have made.
While you can still find them if you know where to look, I don't agree with what the old versions said.
As such, I am also not embarrassed to keep these posts hidden but easily accessible.

I wish the same would be commonplace in speech and over casual text.
I often say something and immediately realise that my words do not convey the meaning I had in mind.
In this case, it is nice to be given the opportunity to say "whoops, I don't agree with that" and to try again.
Similarly to how I am not embarrassed of my old blog posts, I am not embarrassed of what I may have said in this situation.
I try again.

While I try not to let it happen, it may be that I say something accidentally offensive or rude to someone.
It is unfortunately common to see people get offended and/or hurt by this,
and trying to apologise and explain takes a lot of effort.
It would be nice if people adopted the "try again" attitude and let you change your mind,
disregarding any previous statements you might have made.

Letting people change their minds about what they have said also lets people communicate more freely.
Instead of thinking what to say and how to say it,
one can simply try saying something and change their mind later if they feel like it.
And the change does not have to be immediate - one can also have one opinion,
go down a long train of thought, and then realise that they want to change what they thought earlier.
That's fine, too.

Reserve the right to change your mind.
You do not have to have the same thoughts you did 2 seconds (or 5 minutes, or a year) ago.
